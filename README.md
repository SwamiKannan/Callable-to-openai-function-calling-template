# Convert a Python function definition into its representation in the Openai tool calling template
![](images/cover.png)

 ## Introduction
 OpenAI has defined the LLM standard template for [tool calling](https://platform.openai.com/docs/assistants/tools/function-calling) . This helps multiple open-source fine tuners define the same standard template for their function calling models. It also helps inference support platforms like [Ollama](https://ollama.com/) and [Llama.cpp](https://github.com/ggerganov/llama.cpp) use these templates to execute function calls on their platforms.
